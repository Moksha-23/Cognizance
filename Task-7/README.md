## Theme : 
* I had created a landing page the topic of "online booking" with the website named "Travel Hub".
* Here you can choose from one place to another place then it will show the availabilty by taxi, train, bus and flight .
* From that results if u want to go through that from there itself you can book.

## Motivation for selecting this topic : 
1. Easy to find
2. Easy to use
3. Easy on the eye
4. Anywhere, anytime, any device
5. Speedy booking process
6. Reducing admin time for staff
7. Real-time reporting
8. Upselling and cross-selling
9. Stay in touch
10. Safety first
* Most of the customers will expect to be able to find our business on the internet. 
* Whether you are selling your tickets online, or simply want to provide some information about your business and your contact details, having a website is almost essential.

## Future Improvements:-
* We are trying to add the bookings for hotels and restaurant.
* <div> we will add live running status.</div>
