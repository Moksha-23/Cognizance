I had completed Task-3 (Design A Landing Page On Any Genre Using Either Figma Or Adobe XD) through Figma.
I took the topic of "online booking" with the website named "Travel Hub".
In Figma, I took the desktop-sized layout,then I attached the background.
And created my logo with “canva logo maker”, 
I had used rectangular frameworks for highlighting the options and I gave color to that .
Then added text and aligned properly for describing my landing page on Travel Hub.
